# MachineLearningApplications

### ClassDI.ipynb
ML assignment using a DIGITS dataset from sklearn. Initially we perform some dataset analysis tasks, followed by principal component analysis using sklearn and the implementation of k-nn sklearn algorithm. We present how the algorithms performance changes by adding noise to the dataset.
