# MachineLearningApplications

### ClassDI.ipynb
ML assignment using a DIGITS dataset from sklearn. Initially we perform some dataset analysis tasks, followed by principal component analysis using sklearn and the implementation of k-nn sklearn algorithm. We present how the algorithms performance changes by adding noise to the dataset.

### LogReg.ipynb
Implementation of Logistic Regression for the IRIS sklearn dataset, performance analysis of the algorithms, use of PCA for dimensionality reduction, classification report and confusion matrix. 

### PCA.ipynb
Principal Component Analysis. The notebook contains:
i) Implementation of PCA to the digits dataset from scikit-learn. 
ii) Noise and Dimensionality Reduction on the dataset.
iii) Eigenfaces if the dataset.

### RidgeLasso.py
Lasso and Ridge implementation. Coefficients optimization and error analysis.
